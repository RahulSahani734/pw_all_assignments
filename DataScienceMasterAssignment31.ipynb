    "\n",
    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the estimation of population parameters from sample data. A point estimate is a single value estimate of a population parameter. For example, the sample mean is a point estimate of the population mean. An interval estimate is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of the population parameter. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the population mean is an interval that is likely to contain the true population mean with 95% confidence."
