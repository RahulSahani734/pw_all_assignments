    "Measures of dispersion, including range, variance, and standard deviation, are used to describe the spread or variability of data points within a dataset. These measures provide insights into how tightly or widely the data is distributed around the central tendency (mean, median, or mode). Let's explore each measure and provide an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Range**:\n",
    "The range is the simplest measure of dispersion. It is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. While it gives an immediate sense of how spread out the data is, it only considers two extreme points and doesn't capture the distribution between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider two datasets of test scores: Dataset A: [75, 80, 85, 90, 95] and Dataset B: [60, 70, 80, 90, 100]. Both datasets have the same range of 20 points, but Dataset B has more variability, as the scores are more spread out from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Variance**:\n",
    "Variance quantifies how much individual data points deviate from the mean. It is calculated by averaging the squared differences between each data point and the mean. A higher variance indicates more variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's say we have two datasets representing the ages of students in two schools:\n",
    "Dataset X: [12, 14, 15, 15, 16]\n",
    "Dataset Y: [10, 13, 14, 18, 20]\n",
    "Although both datasets have the same range of 4, Dataset Y has a higher variance because the ages are more spread out from the mean, indicating greater variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Standard Deviation**:\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of average deviation from the mean. A larger standard deviation indicates greater spread or variability in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider the monthly rainfall data (in inches) for two cities:\n",
    "City P: [2, 2.5, 1.8, 2.2, 2.3]\n",
    "City Q: [0.5, 4.5, 0.3, 3.8, 0.7]\n",
    "Both cities have the same mean rainfall of approximately 2.16 inches. However, City Q has a higher standard deviation, indicating that its rainfall is more variable from month to month compared to City P.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, measures of dispersion like range, variance, and standard deviation provide valuable information about how data points are distributed around the central tendency. They help quantify the degree of variability and spread within a dataset, enabling better understanding of its characteristics and potential implications."

    "Outliers are data points that significantly deviate from the rest of the data in a dataset. They can have a notable impact on both measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and measures of dispersion (range, variance, standard deviation). The presence of outliers can skew these measures and lead to misrepresentations of the data's characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Effects on Measures of Central Tendency**:\n",
    "- **Mean**: Outliers, especially extreme values, can pull the mean towards their direction. If there's a high outlier, the mean will be pulled upward; if there's a low outlier, the mean will be pulled downward.\n",
    "- **Median**: The median is less affected by outliers compared to the mean. A few extreme values won't impact the median as much, as it focuses on the middle value.\n",

    "- **Median**: The median is 26. The outlier doesn't have a significant impact on the median, as it's just one value.\n",
    "- **Range**: The range is 100 - 20 = 80, showing the effect of the outlier on the spread of the data.\n",
