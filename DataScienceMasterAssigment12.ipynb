    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems that differ in their data models, query languages, and underlying architectures:\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases:\n",
    "- SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which organizes data into tables with predefined schema and relationships.\n",
    "- They use SQL as the standard query language for defining and manipulating data.\n",
    "- SQL databases ensure data integrity by enforcing constraints and supporting transactions.\n",
    "- They provide a structured approach to data management and are suitable for applications with well-defined schemas and complex relationships.\n",
    "- Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases:\n",
    "- NoSQL databases employ flexible data models that do not rely on fixed schemas.\n",
    "- They offer a variety of data models, including key-value stores, document databases, columnar databases, and graph databases.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases use various query languages specific to their data model, which may differ from traditional SQL.\n",
    "- They are designed to handle large-scale distributed systems and provide high scalability and performance.\n",
    "- NoSQL databases are often used for applications with rapidly changing or unstructured data, such as social networks, real-time analytics, and content management systems.\n",
    "- Popular NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, Couchbase, and Neo4j.\n"

    "\n",
    "DDL stands for Data Definition Language. It is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database schema. DDL statements are responsible for creating, modifying, and deleting database objects such as tables, indexes, views, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DDL statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE:\n",
    "The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, or constraints. For example, to create a table named \"Employees\" with columns for \"ID,\" \"Name,\" and \"Salary,\" you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
    "    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    Name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    Salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP:\n",
    "The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects. It permanently removes the specified object and its associated data from the database. For example, to drop the previously created \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER:\n",
    "The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or removing columns or changing data types. For example, to add a new column named \"Age\" to the \"Employees\" table, you would use the ALTER TABLE statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE Employees\n",
    "ADD Age INT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE:\n",
    "The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table while keeping its structure intact. It is faster than deleting rows one by one using the DELETE statement. For example, to remove all data from the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE Employees;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These DDL statements are essential for managing the structure of a database and performing operations such as creating tables, altering their structure, deleting objects, or removing data."

    "\n",
    "Here's an explanation of the commonly used DML statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. INSERT:\n",
    "The INSERT statement is used to add new records or rows into a table. It allows you to specify the values for each column or provide the values from a subquery. For example, to insert a new employee record into the \"Employees\" table, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (ID, Name, Salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'John Doe', 50000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement inserts a new row with an ID of 1, Name of 'John Doe', and Salary of 50000 into the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. UPDATE:\n",
    "The UPDATE statement is used to modify existing records in a table. It allows you to change the values of one or more columns based on specified conditions. For example, to update the salary of an employee with ID 1 to 60000, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UPDATE Employees\n",
    "SET Salary = 60000\n",
    "WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement updates the \"Salary\" column to 60000 for the employee with ID 1 in the \"Employees\" table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. DELETE:\n",
    "The DELETE statement is used to remove records from a table based on specified conditions. It allows you to selectively delete one or more rows. For example, to delete all employees with a salary less than 50000, you would use the following SQL statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Salary < 50000;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement deletes all rows from the \"Employees\" table where the \"Salary\" column is less than 50000.\n",
    "\n",
    "These DML statements are essential for manipulating and managing the data stored in database tables. They allow you to insert new data, update existing data, and delete unwanted data to keep your database up-to-date and relevant."

    "Here's an explanation of the SELECT statement with an example:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT Name, Salary\n",
    "FROM Employees\n",
    "WHERE Salary > 50000;\n",

    "\n",
    "You can also use additional clauses with the SELECT statement, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ORDER BY: to sort the results based on one or more columns. For example, adding \"ORDER BY Salary DESC\" would sort the results in descending order of the salary.\n",
    "- LIMIT: to limit the number of rows returned. For example, adding \"LIMIT 10\" would retrieve only the first 10 rows.\n",
    "- JOIN: to combine data from multiple tables based on common columns.\n",

    "cursor.close()\n",
    "connection.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, you import the `mysql.connector` module to use the MySQL Connector/Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Then, you establish a connection to your MySQL database by providing the host, user, password, and database details. Replace \"your_username,\" \"your_password,\" and \"your_database\" with your actual credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After establishing the connection, you create a cursor object using the `cursor()` method. The cursor object allows you to execute SQL queries and fetch results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You can execute SQL queries using the `execute()` method of the cursor object. In the example, a SELECT query is executed to fetch all records from a table named \"your_table\".\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The `fetchall()` method retrieves all the rows returned by the query and stores them in the `results` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finally, you can iterate over the `results` and print each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Lastly, remember to close the cursor and connection using the `close()` method to release the resources properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object that enables you to execute SQL queries and fetch the results. It acts as a pointer or handle to the result set of a query. The cursor object provides various methods, such as `execute()`, `fetchone()`, `fetchall()`, etc., to interact with the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL statements or queries. It takes an SQL query as a parameter and sends it to the MySQL server for execution. In the example, the `execute()` method is used to execute the SELECT query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Make sure you have the `mysql-connector-python` library installed. You can install it using pip: `pip install mysql-connector-python`."

    "\n",

    "\n",
